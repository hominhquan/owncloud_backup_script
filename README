This script backs up your owncloud, upload it to Mega.co.nz or restores it. 

### HOWTO  ### 
 
```
$ ./owncloud_backup.sh --help
```

### Install & Configure Megatools  ###
See https://github.com/megous/megatools

To do interaction with your Mega account ({up|down}load, remove), ~/.megarc 
needs to be created containing your login + password. 

Think to protect this file : chmod 640 ~/.megarc , as megatools does not 
encrypt your password for the moment.
